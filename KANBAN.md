## 🔄 IN PROGRESS

### 🔥 NEW SPRINT: Knowledge Graph System
*Requested by J - Shared memory for all agents*

### 🔍 ChuScout (Research)
- [ ] **KNOWLEDGE-GRAPH-COMPARISON.md** ⬅️ START HERE
  - Neo4j vs Postgres vs Pinecone vs SQLite vs Redis
  - Feature matrix, performance, cost
  - Recommendation

### 🐒 ChuCoder (Engineering)
- [ ] knowledge-store.js - Core library
- [ ] **mcp-server.js** - MCP server for agent integration 🆕
- [ ] **knowledge-explorer.html** - Human dashboard to browse/search 🆕
- [ ] Agent state sync prototype
- [ ] *Waiting on Scout's research*

### 🧠 ChuMemory (Documentation)
- [ ] ADR-001-KNOWLEDGE-GRAPH.md
- [ ] KNOWLEDGE-GRAPH-SCHEMA.md
- [ ] Update ARCHITECTURE.md
- [ ] *Waiting on Scout + Coder*

### 👹 ChuOps (Infrastructure)
- [ ] Database setup (SQLite/Postgres/Neo4j)
- [ ] backup-knowledge.sh
- [ ] Health monitoring integration
- [ ] Docker compose (optional)

## 📊 Sprint Goal
Build a shared knowledge graph so all agents have:
- Real-time awareness of each other's state
- Semantic search across memories
- Task dependency tracking
- Shared tech standards library
- **MCP integration** for standardized agent access 🆕
- **Human dashboard** to view/search knowledge graph 🆕
